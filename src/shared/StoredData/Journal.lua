So, day 1 journaling. Not really sure what to say here. I already put everything in my logs.
Did some work on the core for a few hours. Talked to Dyson for a while. 
First time talking to that guy. He's a bit odd, but interesting. He made some good points about VAX's position in the US Gov
I don't know if I agree, but interesting nonetheless.]],

This isn't so bad. Not really sure why it's mandatory, but it helps. 

Dyson tried talking to me for a bit. He seems a bit radical. 
Not sure why he even works here to be honest. I always feel like he's judging me whenever we talk. I don't know. Maybe it's just me.

Anyway, what'd I do today? Refined some of the code for Veles. It looks like they're coming along nicely. 
Still trying to figure out how to get past the blockage though.

I don't care what they see. I don't care what they hear. A stupid piece of paper. That's their solution?
Dyson is right. These people are insane; this is insane. What are we doing!? People are dying. People are dying! I'm tired, I'm stuck. 

Okay. I feel okay. I'm okay. It's almost over.
Yeah, these help.]],

Mad with pain.
Mad with disgust.
Mad with hate.

I will atone. I must atone.]],
